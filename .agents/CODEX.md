# Codex Workflow Catalog

## Delivery Flow

The user-facing sequence is `product_owner` -> human approval -> `builder` -> `dev_ops` when
release or code-documentation work is requested.

`builder` delegates preparation to `engineer` before TDD. The engineer creates the plan and the
applicable ER model. Specification status ownership follows the same flow:

Each work item owns one stable specification file and that specification owns one stable plan.
Revisions update those files in place instead of creating parallel artifacts.

- `product_owner`: creates or updates the specification as `Draft`.
- Human approval: explicitly authorizes the exact `Draft` revision for builder.
- `builder`: records the approved handoff as `Approved` on its task branch.
- `engineer`: advances `Approved` to `Planned` after planning and applicable data modeling.
- `builder`: advances `Planned` to `Coded`, then `Verified`, based on implementation and evidence.
- `dev_ops`: advances included `Verified` specifications to `Released` during a release.

## Custom Agents

| Agent | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `product_owner` | Maintain one lifecycle specification for a work item. |
| `engineer` | Prepare implementation plans and applicable data models for builder. |
| `builder` | Coordinate committed implementation cycles and perform declared direct imports. |
| `tester` | Establish RED by changing tests only. |
| `coder` | Implement the minimum change for GREEN. |
| `cleaner` | Perform behavior-preserving REFACTOR. |
| `dev_ops` | Handle requested code documentation and releases. |
| `craftsman` | Maintain Codex agents, skills, prompts, and evaluations. |
